Lua 5.1 Obfuscator
----
SIDE NOTE: This obfuscator isn't practical for use suggesting to use ironbrew-2 (https://github.com/DefCon42/ironbrew-2) as you could use unluac or luadec to convert the luac to a lua source code, my part looks horrible i agree
----
Story: This isn't written by me i got hands of it by unverified (https://github.com/Unverifieds) this developer isn't really competent at all i don't see a reason not to leak it (i wrote the backend) and i have wrote this type of obfuscator in the past
